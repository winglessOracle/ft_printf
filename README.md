ft_printf is a CODAM assignment (part of 42 network).
The goal is to write a simple version of the standard printf function. 
This assignment is also an introduction to variadic functions in c.
The function should copy the behaviour and output of printf excluding
formatting flags (those are part of the bonus).
The assignment requires you to use your own library of standard c functions
(libft). This is added in a seperate folder and compiled toghether with the ft_printf functions.

### Requirements
The functions are written in C and require compiling with GCC or CLANG. libft libraries is used.

### Instructions
I have provided a Makefile to compile both the ft_printf functions and the libft library.
